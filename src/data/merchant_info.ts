    "Short Description": "3 Times began as a culinary vision to replicate the popularity of the Taiwan-based Din Tai Fung by developing a brand of quality, authentic Chinese cuisine in the heart of New York City. The restaurant is most famous for its handmade soup dumplings, but also serves dishes that span across all regions of China ‚Äî from Nanjing salted duck, to Hangzhou‚Äôs sweet potato noodle & beef soup, to Shanghainese spicy wontons; it‚Äôs the reason its slogan is ‚Äúsoup dumplings and more.‚Äù",

    "Story": "The owner of 3 Times, Jason, used to work as a tour guide in NYC, and one of his most important tasks was finding authentic Chinese restaurants for his tour groups. Inspired by Din Tai Fung‚Äôs success on the West Coast, Jason hoped to develop a similar brand of quality Chinese cuisine in New York that would be loved by Chinese and American foodies alike. He recruited some of the best Chinese chefs in town, including Chef Xu, who had been making soup dumplings for more than forty years, as well as other chefs known for their extensive experience in cooking Chinese entrees.\n\n3 Times‚Äô dedication to quality is like no other ‚Äî the team spares no expense to ensure that each dish meets high standards of authenticity. At 3 Times, the cooks make everything from scratch, using only the finest ingredients. The team also spends a great deal of time brainstorming new recipes to keep their customers happy; 3 Times has a handle on the classics but it‚Äôs also always on the lookout for the latest trends.\n\nWhen 3 Times opened on 90 Clinton St. and 818 Broadway in October 2019, business started off with a bang. Lines went out the door and diners typically waited more than an hour to be seated. But 3 Times took a hard hit with COVID-19. With indoor dining closed, and outdoor dining rendered nearly impossible by city fines and the cold weather, 3 Times is relying on selling frozen versions of their popular dim sum options to stay afloat.\n\nThe most pressing priority for Manager Jasmine is to take care of her staff, who rely on their jobs to provide for their families. Oftentimes, the staff members are the sole providers for their multigenerational families and losing the income from their job would be devastating. Jasmine loses sleep over it sometimes ‚Äî these employees are like family to her, and it breaks her heart knowing that they might lose their livelihoods given current circumstances.\n\n3 Times did its best to not lay off any employees in the early months of the pandemic, but despite best efforts, funds have dried up and there‚Äôs no money left to keep employees on. 3 Times used to have 16 dim sum workers before the pandemic ‚Äî now they barely have six. With a shortage in both funds and labor, everyone pitches in to wash dishes, from the head chef to the manager.\n\nLet‚Äôs help more customers discover 3 Times so that Jason, Jasmine, their chefs and their staff can continue to pursue their mission to bring their unique style of authentic, diverse Chinese cuisine to the East Coast.",

    "Story": "46 Mott is a Cantonese-style bakery best known to the Chinatown community for its work to provide free meals to those in need during the COVID crisis. Patrick Mock, the manager of the Cantonese bakery has partnered with Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou and community volunteers in order to secure funds to provide 200 meals a day to anyone in the community who might need it. As a native New Yorker, Patrick graduated from Brooklyn College and worked as a manager of a dim sum restaurant while attending college. His passion for serving the community led him to managing 46 Mott starting in 2018. By day he manages and runs the bakery along with 4 employees who he considers family, and by night he is a freelance consultant, providing expertise in branding and marketing.\n\n46 Mott has no formal menu. Instead, customers come into this quintessential bakery to explore the day‚Äôs offerings: new ingredients that are seasonal, foods that are trending, and more. Before Mock, the bakery sold less than 10 items and now sells over 46 different items. Here, you can expect the traditional foods you know and love but with a touch of new. And you can‚Äôt go wrong with their top sellers -- the tofu pudding and rice cakes.\n\nOver time, the employees at 46 Mott have become a closely knit team built on trust and experience. It is a bakery built on fostering relationships and building up the community. The employees look forward to seeing the neighborhood aunties and uncles every morning, some of whom have become their regular customers. Mock‚Äôs passion for serving his community led him to feed the low-income, elderly, or homeless during the pandemic by distributing roughly 100 free meals a day.\n\nIn an interview with NBC Asian America, Mock said ‚ÄúIn a pandemic, it makes you pull yourself up from deep down. You've got to step up a little more and if I need to do that right now, this is what I need to do.‚Äù Let‚Äôs all step up a little more and support Mock as he continues to support the most vulnerable communities in Chinatown.",

    "Short Description": "A Chinatown staple since 1985, Peter Li‚Äôs meat shop 47 Division Street Trading Inc. has been indispensable to its largely low-income, immigrant clientele. The family-run business sells diverse cuts at wholesale prices, offering everything from chicken leg ($0.89/lb) to oxtail ($5.99). Peter‚Äôs son, Jeff, has worked at the store since he was a child, and sweats long hours to keep the business afloat and the community fed. Faced with gentrification, aging parents and, now, the discrimination and low foot-traffic brought on by COVID, Jeff is hitting the pavement to generate business, reaching out to communities outside Chinatown through door-to-door knocking ‚Äî and through a [Reddit post that‚Äôs gone viral](https://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/hvxiku/cheap_meat/).",
    "Image URLs": "",
    "Story": "Owner Peter Li learned the butchering trade in China, during a time of job and food scarcity. After immigrating to America for a better life for his wife and future kids, Peter bought the meat shop from its aging owner; it was one of the only ways to support his family with his limited English ability. His son, Jeff, started out as a cashier before taking on labor-intensive tasks like stocking items at the age of 12. Growing up, his parents would work 16-hour days to keep the business afloat and build an easier life for their children. The shop required professional and personal sacrifice from the entire family. Now, Jeff handles everything from paperwork to deliveries ‚Äî anything to keep their legacy alive.\n\n47 Division St operates both retail and wholesale services. The store‚Äôs low prices (the cheapest item, chicken drumsticks, go for $0.50/lb) are a huge attraction to the Chinatown community, which has a high poverty rate. Many of the Li‚Äôs customers are aunties and grandmas who are on food stamps and have limited income. Being located right across from an elementary school also makes the shop a convenient choice for parents picking up their kids. The family is committed to giving back to the community, and has been providing free groceries to those in need during the COVID pandemic.\n\nLike many small Chinatown businesses, the Li family‚Äôs meat shop is a no-frills operation. The employees do not speak English, and signs are made with wood and sharpies. Because of this, it‚Äôs been hard to attract business from the waves of newer, wealthier residents. Instead, Jeff has recently begun to reach out to Hispanic and Black members of the local community, many of whom cook dishes that use the same cuts as their Asian customers. His unabashed, candid message on Reddit, meanwhile, helped generate an uptick of customers from outside their usual customer demographic. In addition to promoting his own family‚Äôs business, Jeff also supports businesses in other local communities.\n\nHelp support this generational business, and the community that relies on it, through a donation or voucher purchase.",

After immigrating to New York in the 90s, they worked at restaurants, where they learned English and reunited with each other. They have been small business owners for more than two decades, starting with a take-out restaurant opened shortly after their first daughter‚Äôs birth. Dedicated to giving their daughters access to better education, the Li family later moved to Syracuse, where they operated a gift shop. 10 years ago, they returned to NYC and started Boc Boc Chicken to earn money for their daughters‚Äô college tuition.\n\nThe Li‚Äôs knew they had to bring something new and exciting to the Queens Center Mall food scene if they wanted to obtain a lease from the managers. They tapped into their love of Korean-style fried chicken, making them to order with fresh, high-quality ingredients. A customer favorite is the #5 combo: breast strips with a side, drink, and garlic bread. And for just $5, Boc Boc offers fried chicken with dressing, french fries and a drink with a side of warm customer service to boot.\n\nNow, Boc Boc‚Äôs situation is dire. Even in the early days of the pandemic, they were losing business as fear set in to the community. On the last day of business before mandatory closure, they made only 12% of their usual revenue. When the mall closed, they could not even offer takeout, but had to continue paying their monthly rent of $23k. Right now they owe $180k in rent with no way of making profit. Despite re-opening, few customers are willing to go indoors for takeout, and they cannot take advantage of outdoor dining. The Li‚Äôs have prioritized paying their employees, many of whom have been with them since the beginning and who are also immigrant parents providing for their kids. Unfortunately, their PPP loans will run out by the end of the month.\n\nRuth and Bin are confident that they have the endurance to survive the pandemic, but they need more customers so they can earn back the money they lost when the mall was closed to pay wages and rent. Let‚Äôs funnel support and business to Boc Boc, and help the Li‚Äôs and their employees continue to serve delicious, affordable fried chicken while supporting their families!",

    "Story": "Kent Zhang is originally from Beijing, where he worked in numerous restaurants and built up familiarity with Dongbei and Shandong cuisine. He began his journey in America working as a cab driver, but returned to the restaurant industry soon after immigrating. Because of the larger Cantonese and Fujianese population in NYC, he was able to expand his culinary knowledge by becoming familiar with these cuisines.\n\nZhang, a practicing vegan Buddhist, opened the original location of Bodhi Kosher Vegan in Flushing in 1999. It was one of the only vegetarian, and perhaps the only vegan, restaurant in the area at the time. Even now, a vegetarian Chinese restaurant is still not easy to find ‚Äî Zhang‚Äôs restaurant truly fills a niche. On top of that, Zhang was wisely advised to apply for Kosher certification.\n\nAfter a successful 13-year run in Flushing, Zhang opened his Manhattan Chinatown location and quickly attracted both a loyal customer base as well as a steady stream of tourists. With a central location on Mulberry Street, Bodhi Kosher is a frequent stop for visitors who often don‚Äôt even realize it‚Äôs a vegan restaurant.\n\nZhang is a one-of-a-kind restaurant-owner who truly takes the time to learn about his customers. He knows his crowd is from all over ‚Äî vegan Chinese food appeals to Chinese Buddhists, health-conscious elderly, vegetarian Hindus, pork-avoiding Muslims, kosher-only Jewish people, and tourists who just stumble into his restaurant. Mandarin is his native language, but he also speaks English, Cantonese, and even knows some Hebrew, all learned from daily interactions with his wide-ranging clientele. When he gets Chinese customers, he figures out which part of China they‚Äôre from based on their accent and recommends dishes with flavors that are uncommon to their region so they can try something new. Because of Zhang‚Äôs varied experience, Bodhi has cuisines from all over China.\n\nSince COVID, Bodhi Kosher has lost more than 75% of its regular business. The usual tourists are gone, and health-conscious elderly who previously came to his restaurant for healthy vegan food are less likely to venture outside. He‚Äôs put his restaurant on all the delivery platforms, but it‚Äôs not enough to make up for the lost customers.

    "Short Description": "In Murray Hill, Queens, locals know that the recently opened Chef Papa Vietnamese Kitchen has the best grilled pork chops and steaming hot pho in town, but what many don‚Äôt know is that this restaurant was borne from the love of a son who never stopped encouraging his father to follow his dreams.",

    "Story": "Head Chef John and his son, also named John, are the dynamic duo who run the small Queens eatery known as Chef Papa Vietnamese Kitchen. Along with John‚Äôs mom, they work tirelessly in the restaurant seven days a week, serving up quality and authentic Vietnamese dishes. While the hours can be long and tedious, John feels that the compliments and words of encouragement from their customers make it all worth it. ‚ÄúThe feeling that someone not only supports us, but actually believes in us and thinks we can become successful ‚Äî that‚Äôs what keeps me going,‚Äù says John.\n\nAlthough Chef John has always had an innate talent and love for cooking, at one point, he doubted that his culinary talents were enough to keep him afloat in the relentless NYC food service industry. The family previously owned another restaurant that eventually closed down, leading Chef John to believe he was too old to stay in the business. John, however, felt that his father‚Äôs talents as a chef would go to waste if he gave up on the restaurant business, and insisted that his family give it another try; more importantly, John knew that his father simply wouldn‚Äôt be happy if he couldn‚Äôt cook for others.\n\nIn late 2019, the family decided to give it another shot and signed a lease on the small storefront in Murray Hill, Queens that would eventually become Chef Papa Vietnamese Kitchen. They were excited for the opportunity to start anew, but it all came crashing down in early 2020, when COVID hit. For months, Chef Papa was completely inoperable ‚Äî construction on the restaurant was paused, and take-out and deliveries weren‚Äôt an option because Chef Papa hadn‚Äôt received its food license yet. The family feared that Chef Papa would close down without even getting a fighting chance.\n\nIn July 2020, Chef Papa finally made its debut, bringing decades of Vietnamese history to Queens via traditional family recipes passed down through the generations. While Chef John and his family are now able to share their cooking with their very satisfied community of customers, the restaurant is not in the clear yet. John‚Äôs family is still struggling to just break even, especially given all the losses they suffered in the first half of 2020. Let‚Äôs make sure that Chef John knows how much we believe in his success: donate and buy gift vouchers for Chef Papa Vietnamese Kitchen today.",

Wing cultivated his technique and artistry over 14 years of extensive training and experience, applying the same dedication and rigor to hairstyling that he once did to gymnastics as a national-level athlete.

    "Story": "Wing Guan first immigrated to the United States 17 years ago. He began working in the hairdressing business, and over the years slowly worked his way up to owning his own salon.\n\nHe learned to cut hair at Wuming Fa (now Tease salon), then spent 3 years perfecting his skills at Subimage in Chinatown. He loves coloring hair, and keeps up with all the latest beauty trends to maintain his self-taught coloring skills.\n\nGuan was finally able to open his own place in 2017 - he is now both the founder and leading stylist of Color Matrix Caf√©Salon in the heart of Chinatown. As an innovative fashionista with an artistic soul, Guan wanted to build a unique sense of community and comfort within his salon. As a result, Color Matrix features a cafe in the front, where customers can enjoy a drink (usually bubble tea!) while waiting for a cut, or just for fun. Not only did Guan design the cafe himself - he hand-built and painted all the furniture.\n\nIn September of 2020, a fire broke out on Grand Street, inflicting heavy damage onto Color Matrix Caf√©Salon and forcing the business to shut down. Guan pulled from whatever he had left in his own savings to cover the losses, but is still in debt from the resulting damage. As he runs the salon himself, Guan had to clean nonstop for 3 days.\n\nA true Renaissance man - national gymnast, furniture maker, cafe owner and of course, lover of all things hairstyling - Guan is emblematic of a Chinatown small business owner using his creative flair to not only offer services but to also build community in the neighborhood.\n\nColor Matrix Caf√©Salon is the first collaborative merchant launch between Welcome to Chinatown and Send Chinatown Love. As our teams continue to serve Chinatown's small business community, we look forward to joining forces for future campaigns to come.",

    "Story": "For Daniel, who practically grew up under a Chinese takeout counter, food and beverage come as second nature, and he knew it was only a matter of time before he delved into the industry himself. The idea for Dreamers was first conceived at a senior citizen‚Äôs center. While working as a caretaker, Daniel witnessed the changing landscape of Chinatown over the last seven to eight years. Many of the seniors were being gradually pushed out of their homes by developers who were offering them $150K to move out. These developers had previously gut renovated and replaced many Chinese establishments. Witnessing the slow lights-out of many mom-and-pop shops, Daniel and Sandy built Dreamers Coffee House as a casual spot for locals and newcomers alike to mingle. They find joy in providing a space for the community to come together over coffee.\n\nOpening in January 2020, the shop faced many initial difficulties, especially with early misconceptions about COVID-19 reducing Chinatown‚Äôs foot traffic. Unfortunately, due to its status as a new business, Dreamers Coffee did not qualify for government grants. The shop closed and reopened in June, but traffic has remained slow. Meanwhile, Daniel and Sandy have pitched a number of efforts to connect to the neighborhood and community. They eagerly interact with customers while serving modern drinks like iced London fogs and familiar ones like Cantonese ling mut (honey lemon). In addition, they partner with local businesses and offer them store space to promote their products.\n\nFor the foreseeable future, Dreamers is looking to expand their space and pay off their bank loans. They are looking for ways to keep promoting themselves in order to gain foot traffic and they want to get the word out to the neighborhood that they‚Äôre open for business. Hoping to gain traction, they have been active on Yelp and Instagram. A preemptive closure of Dreamers Coffee would be the loss of another local business and intimate space for Chinatown residents.\n\nDaniel and Sandy have many hopes and aspirations for the shop and need our help to make them a reality. Let‚Äôs pay our way forward and show our support for young Dreamers.",

    "Story": "Go Noodle is a family-owned restaurant with a story of perseverance and hard work representative of the Chinese immigrant community in New York. Coming from a small village in Fuzhou, the owners immigrated to the U.S. in the late 1990s with just about nothing ‚Äî they had little money, couldn‚Äôt speak English, and knew very few people. Even in Fuzhou, both of them were only formally educated in elementary school. However, despite these early challenges, they never gave up hope and strove to work hard in order to  provide their children with the education that they themselves never had.\n\nUpon arrival, the Yangs were immediately introduced by their relatives to the restaurant business. After working in the industry for more than ten years, they finally decided to take over the restaurant where they had been working, when its previous owners retired.\n\nGo Noodle is one of the few Chinese restaurants in Midtown that offers a menu with both a wide variety of Cantonese noodle soups and classic American Chinese dishes. The Yangs speak fondly of the unforgettable noodle dishes they had at a Cantonese restaurant when they first arrived in NYC‚Äôs Chinatown. These memories inspire their unique menu; their passion inspires their dedication to providing the best American Chinese food to Go Noodle‚Äôs customers.\n\nFor the Yangs, the business is so important to them, that Go Noodle could practically be considered one of their children. Over the past 20 years, the Yangs have invested all of their energy and attention into growing this family restaurant. They never take any breaks except on Thanksgiving, but due to COVID-19, this March was the first time the Yangs had closed  the restaurant in 20 years.\n\nTheir workers are family to them. Despite the economic effects of the pandemic, the Yangs are unwilling to lay off their employees. That loyalty is reciprocated as the employees were eager to continue working even in mid-March. However, since the Yangs were aware of the rapid spread of the virus in China and were concerned for the health of their workers, they made the difficult decision to close the restaurant. After two months of a quarantine that has upended everyone‚Äôs lives, the Yangs have decided to cautiously re-open. Currently, only four of the younger employees are working, while the older employees have been asked to stay home for their well-being until the situation improves.",

    "Story": "Twenty-one years ago, Veronica immigrated to the United States from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, leaving behind her career as a fashion designer to start a family in New York. Originally a housewife who cared for her husband and daughter, Veronica entered the food industry due to her nostalgia for kuih: bite-sized Southeast Asian pastries composed of glutinous rice and sweet or savory filling.\n\nAuthentic kuih is difficult to find in New York, as this colorful steamed dish is meticulously prepared in a variety of flavors. Veronica took on the challenge of replicating the taste of her hometown, even utilizing the same natural Southeast Asian ingredients. Countless nights of frequenting libraries, consulting family members, and distributing pastries for feedback led to her top recipes: Kuih, Nasi Lemak, and Pineapple Tart Cookies.\n\nPer the advice of her loved ones, Veronica began taking online orders from customers located throughout the city. She found joy in the kindness and support she received, especially on difficult days. To further her expertise, she attended classes at the International Culinary Center and Institute of Culinary Education. \n\nAfter six years of home baking, Veronica was finally able to open a brick-and-mortar location in Chinatown earlier this year. She single-handedly transported equipment and ingredients to the store in a handcart. Every morning, she wakes up at 7 A.M. to prepare for the day. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, she had to close her doors just a month later. As the only patissi√®re of Kuih Cafe, Veronica is determined to keep her dream alive despite the growing expenses and lack of customers.

    "Story": "Despite humble origins in a small rural Fujianese village, Owner and Head Chef John has always hungered for more. He started working in restaurants at the age of 15 and has continued doing so ever since. He met his equally ambitious wife when they were both teenagers. Inspired by stories of the American Dream, they moved to the States together in 1998, eventually opening Lanzhou Ramen on East Broadway in 2002. \n\nOperating his own business has been no easy feat for John ‚Äî he speaks little English and struggles to keep up with the rapid change of social media trends. The constant for him has been his dedication to his cooking since life in the restaurant business has been the only life he‚Äôs ever really known. The popularity of his signature dish, the beef hand-pulled noodle soup, is a testament to his hard work and perseverance in mastering the art of noodle-making. \n\nLocated away from the tourist-heavy Canal Street, Lanzhou Ramen relied heavily on local Fujianese customers who would stand in lines in front of the restaurant, waiting for a chance to taste John‚Äôs delectable dishes. But once the coronavirus hit, Lanzhou Ramen, like most other East Broadway businesses, suffered immensely from the loss of foot traffic. Struggling to sustain the restaurant, John has reduced the number of staff members in the last few months. \n\nJohn has been serving delectable noodles out of Lanzhou Ramen for nearly two decades, and some of his staff have been with him for many years. Let‚Äôs help Lanzhou Ramen stay open so that John can continue sharing his delicious food with the community, and enjoy a happy and healthy life with his family.",

    "Story": "Ivy, the owner and visionary behind Melonpanna Tea & Shot, wasn‚Äôt always in the restaurant business. After immigrating to America at the age of 13, she went on to pursue a nursing degree and then worked for her family‚Äôs company. Baking, however, had always been a passion for her. As she took a look around Sunset‚Äôs Park‚Äôs Chinese bakery scene, Ivy knew that she could bring something new to the community. This is when she opened Melonpanna Tea & Shot and turned her passion for baking into her American Dream. \n\nSince 2018, Ivy‚Äôs mission for Melonpanna Tea & Shot has always been to bring fun and exciting food items to spark happiness for her community members. When asked about her reason for opening a bakery, she says: ‚ÄúI opened the bakery because I like to look at beautiful things and I like to make people happy.‚Äù After diving deeper into the menu, one can see that baked goods are just the tip of the iceberg. ‚ÄúWe also sell dim sum because I love dim sum. It‚Äôs a time to have everyone from the family together and talk over tea,‚Äù she says, while pointing to the extensive list of dim sum and rice dishes available for customers. ‚ÄúI want to bring everything from my mind into reality.‚Äù\n\nServing joy to the neighborhood through unique cuisine is at the heart of what Ivy does. Since April 24, Ivy and her husband have partially reopened the bakery & caf√© for takeout and delivery, but the road to fully recovering her business from the pandemic‚Äôs impact is still long.

    "Story": "Mr. Dong‚Äôs story starts in 2010, when he immigrated to the United States in pursuit of the classic American Dream. Despite his limited English abilities ‚Äî which restricted his livelihood options to working at construction and renovation sites, restaurants, or hair salons ‚Äî Mr. Dong was determined to find a way to provide for his loved ones by whatever means possible, manual labor included. While his first job was refurbishing printers at a factory, with time, Mr. Dong eventually moved into the hair care services industry as a barber.\n\nIn 2017, the previous owners of New China sold the salon to Mr. Dong, who then took the helm and continued New China‚Äôs tradition of providing trendy and affordable haircuts to the local Chinatown community. Unfortunately, Mr. Dong has fallen onto hard times due to the pandemic, and it has been a struggle to keep up with all the rent, water, and electricity payments, on top of a temporary 3-month closure earlier in 2020.\n\nMr. Dong reflects on how dire the situation has gotten when he explains that he‚Äôs had to raise the cost of a haircut from $8 to $10 ‚Äî something that New China hasn‚Äôt done in over 20 years. Still, the $2 price raise doesn‚Äôt do enough to cover his losses, considering that rent has more than tripled in the last three decades. Mr. Dong notes sadly that keeping the salon open is costing him more money than he can make and just breaking even these days would be considered a relative success.\n\nDespite a significant decrease in business, Mr. Dong doesn‚Äôt want to give up. He has a team of ten hairstylists, who are like family to him, and closing the business would mean putting them out of work. Mr. Dong is determined to see his business through the pandemic ‚Äî let‚Äôs show him that we‚Äôre there beside him as well.",

    "Story": "Wing Lee immigrated to the U.S. in 1992 when he was 20 years old. Ever since then, he‚Äôs been working in kitchens across the country, learning to cook while slowly creating recipes to open his very own restaurant. He met his wife while working in Nashville, Tennessee and moved to Cincinnati after his son was born. In New Jersey, he set the foundations to open his first restaurant but became partially blind after a construction accident. After slowly recovering and regaining confidence, he finally settled in NYC & opened Noodle House.\n\nThere he put his recipes to the test! After trial & error, he curated a menu that would appeal to the diverse community of Elmhurst. With popular renditions of teriyaki chicken to sizzling Chinese pork chops, there‚Äôs something for everyone. But the recipe he‚Äôs most proud of is his Beef Noodle Soup for just $8.\n\nShortly after their 10 year anniversary, the pandemic shut the restaurant down. While the entire food court was legally forced to close for months, the management still charged $23K a month for rent. Now the debt is over $300K and will not be deferred unless they are able to pay $50K by the end of April. With slow foot traffic & dwindling DoorDash orders, they can barely break even, let alone meet management demands.\n\nLet‚Äôs make sure their story doesn‚Äôt end there. The Noodle House recipes just got their start & should have many more years ahead. If you haven‚Äôt tried their signature dishes, be sure to stop by & support or order online before it‚Äôs too late!",

Since its opening in 2016, locals have flocked to Rabbit House for Japanese-style small plates and inventive drinks in a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Yoshiko‚Äôs passion for bringing joy to her customers through delicious food and drinks makes each visit to her restaurant a special experience.",

    "Story": "Growing up in Japan as a child of restaurant owners and a grandchild of farmers, Yoshiko has always loved and appreciated fresh food and quality ingredients. She moved to New York in 1996, where she eventually decided to pursue a culinary career, enrolling in a degree in European cooking. After graduation, her passion and talent propelled her through a decade and a half of working in world-renowned restaurants and bakeries across New York, Spain, and Italy.\n\nWhen it was time to finally make her own mark on the culinary world, she returned to the Lower East Side: where her journey began, where her dreams of opening her own restaurant first took root 15 years before. Rabbit House is an expression of Yoshiko‚Äôs lengthy and wide-ranging career as a chef and sommelier, as well as her own heritage. She serves European-influenced, Japanese-style tapas and an omakase prix-fixe meal that changes seasonally, alongside sake and wine pairings, or creative cocktails. Customers mostly come for the omakase, but other favorites include the Addicted Spare Rib, the Trapped Rabbit, and various vegan and gluten-free options.\n\nRabbit House takes its name from its tiny size, like a ‚Äúrabbit hut‚Äù, with only 15 seats in its original location. Yoshiko loves the small size though, explaining that ‚Äúit allows us to be closer to our guests and share good times and memories together.‚Äù The intimacy of the experience is one of the many things that make a meal at Rabbit House special and memorable. The New Yorker described the restaurant as a ‚Äúcozy spot on the Lower East Side, which is so quirky and comfortable that drinking flights of sake at the bar feels like sitting in someone‚Äôs living room.‚Äù\n\nHowever, after COVID-19 hit, Rabbit House saw a 95% drop in business, made worse by the ban on indoor dining. Yoshiko has worked hard to adapt to the challenges of staying open during a pandemic. She started offering delivery and pickup, although some days she would only get a single order. She added ramen offerings for lunchtime and late-night service, available under her Ramen Usagi project, which she runs out of the same space. She even constructed her own tiny outdoor dining structure outside the restaurant! With the return of indoor dining this past February, business has improved, but Rabbit House is not out of the tunnel yet. Let‚Äôs make sure we keep Yoshiko‚Äôs dream alive and simultaneously preserve one of the treasures of the Lower East Side--reserve a table, place an order online, buy gift cards, or donate today!",

It is the story of reclaiming one‚Äôs own path and taking charge‚Äîbeing one‚Äôs own boss after years of working long, back-breaking hours in various service jobs just to support themselves and their families.\n\nShunfa Bakery opened as a family establishment, and remains one to this day. Family was, and is still, the driver and key motivator in building this bakery from the ground up: family in the sense of children and parents, but also, family in the sense of the community. Shunfa Bakery has earned its place in Brooklyn‚Äôs nimble but strong Chinatown, serving Chinese comfort food, and hopes to continue to stay strong not just for business, but for our family.‚Äù",

    "Short Description": "Sporting a dark green awning emblazoned with bright white letters, Sun‚Äôs Organic Garden Chinatown (SOGC) has been a cheerful staple of the Bayard Street business block since 2010. Inside this tea lover‚Äôs oasis are rows upon rows of organic teas and herbs ranging from classic teas like Green and Pu‚Äôerh (some dating back to the 1970s) - to rarer finds like Himalayan Shilajit, Wild Blue Lotus flowers, and Yunnan Black Tea from wild ancient trees over 500+ years old. Natalie, SOGC‚Äôs owner (aka the #chinatowntealady) also readily dispenses her wealth of tea and wellness knowledge, ensuring each customer enjoys each cup to the last drop.",
    "Image URLs": "",
    "Story": "For Natalie, SOGC was an embodiment of her dream to serve her community with alternative practical and affordable healthy advice after struggling with her own recovery post 9/11. She discovered the charming spot, resembling a shop right out of Diagon Alley, while shopping in Chinatown, when an ‚ÄúORGANIC TEA‚Äù sign caught her eye in 2016. Organic tea was a rarity in Chinatown, and after trying the loose leaf teas & herbal formulas, she knew she had discovered something great. Fast forward to 2019, her dream was realized when the former owner of Sun‚Äôs retired and passed on the torch of becoming the shop‚Äôs owner, tea sommelier and wellness guru to her. \n\nMore than just a tea shop, Sun‚Äôs is a calming oasis among the hustle and bustle of NY Chinatown. Natalie‚Äôs customers trust her to recommend the right tea or herb for every flavor palate & need, curated from only reputable vendors in China, Taiwan, India, Africa and the rest of the world. For the elderly population and ethnic community of Chinatown and Manhattan, it is an essential and beloved local shop to get quality tea and health-boosting and anti-aging herbs. SOGC also offers a holistic and non-Western approach towards wellness that is rooted in both tradition & science - one that is much needed and often lacking in New York. Customers everywhere come for the quality products but experience much more than that ‚∏∫ they leave enriched and more knowledgeable about both Chinese tea culture and holistic wellness.\n\n2020 has presented unique challenges for SOGC. Earlier in 2020, a large fire on Bayard Street blocked off most of the street, eliminating cars and cutting down foot traffic. With COVID-19, tourism and local traffic was further reduced for not only Natalie‚Äôs shop, but also the surrounding Bayard Street businesses. Currently, Natalie can only afford to operate the store 2 days a week.\n\nAs the sole employee of the shop, Natalie remains dedicated to keeping the store open to serve the greater community by giving them access to Chinese tea culture and its rich heritage, and to offer affordable holistic solutions to people‚Äôs health issues. Just a glance at SOGC‚Äôs Google & Yelp reviews show just how much her customers value & appreciate her help & service. Let‚Äôs keep Natalie‚Äôs mission alive and this happy tea shop open. Help Sun‚Äôs Organic Garden Chinatown by donating today.",

    "Short Description": "In the heart of Manhattan‚Äôs Chinatown, Taiwan Bear House serves up an authentic taste of Taiwan from more than 7,000 miles away with their signature bento boxes, filled to the brim with rice, minced pork gravy, stir-fried cabbage, braised egg, and a wide selection of protein choices. Inspired by the flavors of the night markets of her native Taiwan and longing for comfort food that reminded her of home, Kris Kuo partnered with two friends to open Taiwan Bear House in 2015.",

    "Story": "When Kris Kuo first moved to the United States to attend graduate school, she felt homesick. She tried to seek out restaurants serving the dishes that would remind her of her hometown of Tainan, Taiwan, but ultimately came up short. Some friends suggested, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we start our own Taiwanese shop?‚Äù, and the idea of Taiwan Bear House was born.\n\nAt the time that Kris decided to open Taiwan Bear House, she was working as a CPA at an accounting firm. She had no culinary experience, aside from cooking at home for herself or her family. Opening a restaurant was a totally new career path, but she was determined to give it a shot, and to share the Taiwanese classics that weren‚Äôt easily available in Chinatown at the time. Kris decided to focus on bien dang, or Taiwanese bento boxes, a popular comfort food enjoyed by most Taiwanese people, which for her, held specific memories of the night markets of her hometown. To open the restaurant, she enlisted the help of a chef from a famous Taiwan bento box chain store, who briefly came to the United States just to teach her how to source the right ingredients and cook the dishes.\n\nKris and her partners opened Taiwan Bear House in June of 2015, and it has become a destination for not only Taiwanese expats, but also anyone looking for an authentic taste of Taiwan. Popular dishes include the braised pork belly bento and the crispy chicken, which is actually adapted from Kris‚Äôs mom‚Äôs original recipe. A 2016 New York Times review recommended the golden crust pork chop bento, original minced pork bento, night market crispy chicken bento, and fried chicken leg bento. Many customers have personally thanked Kris for helping alleviate their homesickness with her Taiwanese comfort food, and within just a couple years of opening, she had a stable customer base and was even thinking of expanding to more locations.\n\nHowever, the pandemic hit Chinatown businesses hard, and Taiwan Bear House was no exception. Business dropped by at least 40% with the decline in foot traffic and the overnight disappearance of catering events. The streets of Chinatown were dark and deserted, and everyone was worried about their health, so Taiwan Bear House started offering frozen bento box meals that customers could enjoy in the safety of their own homes. Kris had to cut her staff down to just four employees, and she has worked tirelessly during the entire pandemic just to keep her restaurant running. She takes on both front-of-house and back-of-house duties‚Äîshe cooks, works the register, packs orders for takeout, and more. Despite Kris‚Äôs hard work and perseverance, it has been a challenge to pay the rent and the bills. To make matters worse, although Taiwan Bear House is located on Pell St. in the heart of Manhattan‚Äôs Chinatown, it was deemed ineligible for certain NYC small business loan programs because it technically shares a zip code with wealthier neighborhoods such as SoHo and TriBeCa.\n\nAlthough the past year has been a struggle, Kris still finds pride and joy in having her own shop that she started from scratch. To her, Taiwan Bear House‚Äôs story shows that entrepreneurship, and women-owned businesses, can succeed. Let‚Äôs make sure Kris‚Äôs small business can continue to succeed, and keep sharing delicious Taiwanese comfort food with this city.",

    "Story": "Ting‚Äôs Gift Shop opened in 1958, and was one of the first gift shops in Manhattan‚Äôs Chinatown. Eleanor‚Äôs family opened the store shortly after immigrating to New York. They have safeguarded a treasure trove of antiques over the generations; many of the items they sell today were directly imported from Hong Kong and Japan artisans in the 50‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs. Just the other day, a customer bought an incense burner from the 1965 World Fair!\n\nThe gift shop was meant to cater to the Chinese locals, who still make up the majority of customers. Many are loyal for life, patronizing the store during visits back to NYC even after they‚Äôve moved. The Chinese customers often haggle and bargain; consequently, the store has adopted an unofficial price-matching policy.\n\nBest-selling items are representations of the Three Wise Men, Buddhas, and Tie Guan Yin. When younger customers visit, they are often looking for pieces of nostalgia or cultural reckoning. A recent customer in her 20s shopped with the intention of buying everything her grandma had owned in her apartment. Others have looked for toys they played with as kids many years ago.\n\nDue to COVID, Ting‚Äôs Gift Shop was forced to close in March and only reopened in September. Many days, there are no customers, as foot traffic in the area has decreased significantly - Ting‚Äôs first customer since reopening was at the end of October.\n\nEleanor always looks forward to returning clientele like that customer, who‚Äôs made Ting‚Äôs her first stop whenever she gets paid. But the cold weather, dark hours and quiet pedestrian traffic makes staying open a financially difficult decision.\n\nLet‚Äôs support Eleanor in keeping this 62-year-old Chinatown stronghold open for generations to come.",

    "Story": "Tonii‚Äôs grand opening in 2019 marked a new era for the Yee family, who have been in the Chinatown restaurant business for nearly 30 years. The Yees started off with Kam Hing Bakery on Baxter Street, and eventually moved it to Bayard Street, where Tonii‚Äôs is currently located. The family also owned a branch of the bakery in Brooklyn, but recently closed it due to the overwhelming effects of the ongoing pandemic; now, all their businesses operate out of Tonii‚Äôs.\n\nThe Yees work hard to keep their small business afloat, and family is the driving force behind this determination in more ways than one. Elizabeth, who manages the restaurant, hopes to give her parents a break, while simultaneously providing for her own children by maintaining the family business. To her, working at Tonii‚Äôs is more than just a job ‚Äî it‚Äôs also about carrying on the family legacy. The famous sponge cake recipe, originating from Elizabeth‚Äôs grandfather, has been passed down through the Yee family, and Elizabeth sees the restaurant as a way for future generations to remember their family heritage and culture.\n\nHowever with recent events, carrying on the family business has grown increasingly difficult. Many of Tonii‚Äôs employees left once the pandemic hit in March, and while the wellbeing of customers and staff is Elizabeth‚Äôs priority, she has encountered some challenges navigating the new safety measures. Given Tonii‚Äôs proximity to a construction zone and location on the bustling Bayard street, it is difficult for Elizabeth to provide outdoor dining.\n\nNevertheless, the Yees hope to persevere and make the most of their situation ‚Äî let‚Äôs do what we can to help them.",

    "Story": "Hing has been working in Cantonese restaurants in Hong Kong since he was a teenager. He has been in and out of kitchens, making a living with the only trade he‚Äôs ever known.\n\nHing‚Äôs culinary journey in the States began when he left his home city in the late 80s. Following his passion for Cantonese cuisine, he immediately started working for a small Chinese restaurant. Little did he know, this would also lead him to his wife, who worked the front-of-house at that very same restaurant. Together, they decided to return to their roots to start a family.\n\nMoving back to Hong Kong gave Hing the opportunity to further perfect his craft, as he worked for various restaurants across the city over the course of six years. However, this sanctuary of complete familiarity was short-lived. The family decided to move to New York City to take care of Hing's mother and provide their daughter Yuki with better opportunities. From his humble beginnings cooking in restaurant kitchens to now managing Wing Hing Seafood Restaurant, Hing has revitalized his American Dream.\n\nHing started out at Wing Hing Seafood Restaurant as a chef. Before he knew it, four years flew by and he was deeply invested, working long hours and devoting the bulk of his energy to the establishment; as he grew closer to fellow staff members, they became his second family.\n\nWhen the opportunity came for Hing to take on the management reins, he took the chance to reshape the restaurant by accentuating the establishment‚Äôs Cantonese roots. Despite New York City‚Äôs merciless restaurant culture, he was willing to take the risk‚Äîhoping that his passion would allow Wing Hing Seafood Restaurant to thrive.\n\nHowever, sacrifice was necessary. Hing had to transition from normal working hours to fifteen-hour workdays. In Chinese restaurants, there is dim sum and lunch service, a break, then dinner service. For Hing, however, there were few breaks; between services, he was always out running errands and making sure everything would be set for evening service. After evening service, he‚Äôd stay to help clean and close up. He was always the last to leave. Despite the long hours, it is Hing‚Äôs dedication that allows him to provide his customers with the freshest ingredients while maintaining affordable prices. Through traditional Cantonese recipes, he/Wing Hing created a safe space for Chinese Americans: families are brought together, helping later generations reconnect with their culture.\n\nInspired by her parents‚Äô perseverance in achieving their own American Dream, Yuki hopes to own her own restaurant one day. Yuki mentions, ‚ÄúI worry for the future of the restaurant‚Äîthere are so many uncertainties with the current COVID-19 situation. Some restaurants will make it out of the crisis, but many will shutter. Still, I want to remain optimistic. After all, all we can do is hope for the best.‚Äù\n\nWing Hing plays an integral role in the lives of Hing, the staff members and their families, as well as the families of the community it serves. ‚ÄúEvery Sunday, my family would go to get dim sum at Wing Hing. It was a family tradition,‚Äù an anonymous community member says‚Äîa sentiment echoed by many.",

    "Short Description": "Although Chinatown today is typically tourist-filled and family-friendly, gangs ruled its streets in the 1980s, when Winnie‚Äôs Bar first opened. Through all the transformations the neighborhood has undergone over the years, the local dive bar has managed to stay true to its mission and culture. Winnie‚Äôs has always been about comfort, community, and fun enjoyment ‚Äî it‚Äôs a place where customers can get together with their friends, kick it back with Winnie‚Äôs famous Dragon Punch, and karaoke all through the night.",

    "Story": "Winnie‚Äôs Bar first opened in 1987, when Owner Winnie took over the previous establishment at 104 Bayard Street at the suggestion of a close bartending friend. Winnie herself knew almost nothing about running a bar at the time, and her first set of regulars were local Chinatown gangsters; this was not, by any means, Winnie‚Äôs intended clientele, but simply reflective of the gang-dominated nature of Chinatown nightlife in the late 80s.\n\nAs Winnie gained experience running her bar, she developed a steady stream of loyal customers who always returned for the vibrant community and the chance to sing their hearts out. (One particular customer loved the bar so much that he even brought in Scarlett Johansson and Christina Richie on two separate occasions.) Journey‚Äôs ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Stop Believing‚Äù was constantly booming in the background as bar-goers sipped on the specialty red Dragon Punch ‚Äî Winnie‚Äôs boozy take on the classic Hawaiian Punch.\n\nThrough the years, the bar has garnered a number of different reputations (gangster bar, bridge and tunnel bar, hipster bar, NYU bar), but one thing about Winnie‚Äôs has never changed: people return to Winnie‚Äôs time and time again for a laid-back, no-frills experience because they know they‚Äôll all be treated and welcomed the same. Maintaining the friendly culture at Winnie‚Äôs is no coincidence, though. Winnie‚Äôs son, Manager Teddy, explained that they intentionally pick employees who can strike up a conversation with customers even during an intense karaoke session, because their goal is to get customers to be as comfortable and as stress-free as possible when they‚Äôre hanging out at Winnie‚Äôs Bar.\n\nIn 2015, Winnie lost her Bayard Street lease due to the rising rent rates, and that was thought to be the end of a Chinatown legend. To the delighted surprise of many, Winnie‚Äôs Bar made a comeback four years later on 58 East Broadway and business was going strong until the economic effects of COVID-19 hit Chinatown in early 2020, forcing Winnie‚Äôs to temporarily shut down. Winnie and Teddy plan to reopen in the first week of November with social distancing measures and safety precautions carefully put in-place.\n\nWe can keep this Chinatown stronghold from closing down again by donating to them below. In the words of Journey, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt. Stop. Believing!‚Äù",

    "Story": "For Ben, safeguarding the future of Chinatown restaurants is a life mission. The restaurant has been in the family for more than twenty years after it was passed onto them  from close friends. From grandfather to father to son, their number one priority has never changed ‚Äî make high-quality, delicious food at an affordable price.\n\nBen has been interested in the hospitality industry since childhood ‚Äî not out of desire for money, but out of a desire to build impactful companies. A true entrepreneur, he studied business management in college, which has helped him transition Wonton Noodle Garden into the modern era, while continuously learning about digitization on the fly.\n\nBen still eats wontons almost every day. What‚Äôs special about these wontons is that they‚Äôre made differently than the traditional Cantonese style wonton. This results in wontons with an aromatic, succulent mixture of pork and shrimp, setting them apart from other restaurants‚Äô in flavor and texture. \n\nDuring difficult times like the present, customers are what motivate the family to continue operating the business. Ben‚Äôs greatest joy is in keeping up with regulars while expanding the customer base to younger generations. With no business from tourists these days, Ben is relying on returning local customers to keep the restaurant running. Even so, he‚Äôs having a hard time maintaining staff numbers and wages (he‚Äôs had to let go 6 out of 12 employees due to COVID). \n\nLet‚Äôs help Ben support his employees and further his mission to save traditional Chinatown restaurants, so that future generations can enjoy Wonton Noodle Garden‚Äôs delicious offerings!",

While his parents settled into New York City, Mr. Chan perfected his craft at large restaurants and hotels in Shenzhen.

Mr. Chan is most concerned for his 9 dedicated team members, who have been his close friends and confidants prior to Yue Wong. The implications of closing are dire - not only would it impact his life, but would also impact the lives of some of his dearest friends and the Chinatown community as a whole. That‚Äôs a reality that weighs on him everyday.\n\nDuring these uncertain times, Mr. Chan has managed to adapt by reducing the menu to only serving popular items like barbecued meats. He plans to expand the menu to include classic Chinese dishes in the long term, a sign of hope for the future of the restaurant.\n\nLet‚Äôs help Mr. Chan preserve his lifelong dream to make delicious food while supporting his staff and community around him, whose needs he has always kept in the forefront of his mind during the pandemic.",
